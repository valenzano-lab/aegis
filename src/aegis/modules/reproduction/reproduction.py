    Individuals are fertile starting with [[MATURATION_AGE]] (can be 0) until [[MENOPAUSE]] (if 0, no menopause occurs).
    Reproduction can be sexual (with diploid genomes) or asexual (with diploid or haploid genomes).
    When reproduction is sexual, recombination occurs in gametes at a rate of [[RECOMBINATION_RATE]]
    and gametes will inherit mutations at an age-independent rate
    which can be parameterized (genetics-independent) or set to evolve (genetics-dependent).
    Mutations cause the offspring genome bit states to flip from 0-to-1 or 1-to-0.
    The ratio of 0-to-1 and 1-to-0 can be modified using the [[MUTATION_RATIO]].

    If the population is oviparous, [[INCUBATION_PERIOD]] should be set to -1, 1 or greater.
    When it is set to -1, all laid eggs hatch only once all living individuals die.
    When it is set to 0 or greater, eggs hatch after that specified time.
    Thus, when 0, the population has no egg life step.
